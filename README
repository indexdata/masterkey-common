Building this library
=====================

The 'apt' command
-----------------

The build process depends on the "apt" command, which was deprecated
for some reason in Debian wheezy. It exists as part of the
openjdk-6-jdk package, which is what we use for Java builds, but is no
longer part of the /etc/alternatives system.

To work around this, temporarily add the directory containing the JDK
version to your path when building:

$ PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/bin mvn install

Tests
-----

It seems that the test-suite is broken:

	Running com.indexdata.masterkey.pazpar2.client.Pazpar2SettingsTest
	Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 1, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.015 sec <<< FAILURE!

	Results :

	Tests in error: 
	  testFromSearchables(com.indexdata.masterkey.pazpar2.client.Pazpar2SettingsTest): com.indexdata.masterkey.pazpar2.client.Pazpar2ClientConfiguration.<init>(Lcom/indexdata/masterkey/config/ModuleConfiguration;)V

I don't know how to fix that, so for now I am telling mvn not to run
tests at all, using -DskipTests=true. So the build command becomes:

$ PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/bin -DskipTests=true mvn install
